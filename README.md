# DupDump
Created this project because I wanted to port the technique in pypykatz to get prexisting handles to lsass.exe written about here https://skelsec.medium.com/duping-av-with-handles-537ef985eb03
I got the code to get process handles from this Stack Overflow answer here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54872228/c-sharp-how-to-find-all-handles-associated-with-current-process

# SQL
I created this project when I was doing the OSEP exam. It simply makes it easier to do MSSQL attacks on a compromised windows server. It uses kerberos auth to authenticate servers.
