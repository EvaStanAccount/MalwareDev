I wanted to play around with the technique of creating custom shellcode by writing PIC in C / C++ and extracting the opcodes from .text. I first read about the technique here https://bruteratel.com/research/feature-update/2021/01/30/OBJEXEC/ and used the adjuststack.asm and make file that he included here.

peb-lookup.h was gotten from the ired.team post about the same technique here https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/writing-and-compiling-shellcode-in-c#walkthrough
